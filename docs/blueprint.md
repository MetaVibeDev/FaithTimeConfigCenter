- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) for a clean and inviting interface.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), near-white, for spaciousness.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to highlight important actions and status indicators.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, for a clean, modern, neutral UI.
- Use clear, outline-style icons to represent API methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and data types.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure consistent spacing and alignment across the dashboard.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions (e.g., button clicks, data loading).
